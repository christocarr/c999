An early multi-channel video art work (using several monitors or screens) was Wipe Cycle by Ira Schneider and Frank Gillette. Wipe Cycle was first exhibited at the Howard Wise Gallery in New York in 1969 as part of an exhibition titled "TV as a Creative Medium". An installation of nine television screens, Wipe Cycle combined live images of gallery visitors, found footage from commercial television, and shots from pre-recorded tapes. The material was alternated from one monitor to the next in an elaborate choreography.',

    description: `The Brilliant Waltz, commissioned by Teatro Regio of Parma, is an art installation to celebrate Giuseppe Verdi’s musical genius on the occasion of the recent Festival Verdi. The result was a lighting installation concept and idea created by C999 artist and lighting designer, Luca Carapezzi.

    The work was devised to entertain the large local audience and numerous visitors who regularly invade Parma during the period of the international festival. It was designed to meet a precise request from the organizers: to capture public attention and reflect the beauty and grandeur of Verdi through a monumental work of public art.
    
    Brilliant Waltz played with light: moving heads beamed out to illuminate a historical court and cut through the city sky to the notes of Verdi’s famous brilliant waltz. This piece of music has become one of the best-known compositions of its kind thanks to Nino Rota, who orchestrated it for the film “The Leopard” by Luchino Visconti. The notes filled the air as the lights recalled the dance steps.
    
    C999 said “I wanted to create a magical moment in a place where people pass through quickly stride by stride, as their lives rush by. I wanted to create an eye-opening light show that could touch everyone’s hearts, and make the hearts of loving couples beat faster and carry them away in a waltz of music and love.”
    
    Six fifty-foot tall towers were erected, recorded music was played throughout the square, and an exceptional number of moving heads were arranged in a line on a single fifty-yard-long truss, placed fifty feet above the ground.`,
